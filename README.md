# Chordinator

The amazing Chordinator is a React app that will replace all your chord charts in future.
Just type in your root note and the scale degrees you want to add, and the tool will show
you all the matching fretboard positions.

## Examples:

You want to find a new voicing for a Cm7b9 chord?
Enter the following line: C b3 5 b7 b9

You need a spicy D dominant 7 with a sharp 9?
Try this: D 3 5 b7 #9

F full diminished?
Here we go: F 1 b3 b5 bb7

You need the Lydian b7 scale in Bb?
Here is the code: Bb 1 2 3 #4 5 6 b7
